## Introduction

ROQ enables you to generate the first version of your B2B SaaS application in minutes. All you need to do is to
use the [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.ai/) and answer a few basic questions. After 15â€“30 minutes, you will get an email
with links to your deployed application and the source code on GitHub. You'll also get an invitation to ROQ's management
UI called ROQ Console.

The generated application should be seen as a beta version of your final offering. It will be based on your custom user
roles and data schema. You'll get the full source code (MIT license) and can continue your journey from there or 
iterate on the results until you are satisfied with the result.
