# UI Components overview

## Introduction

ROQ UI Components are plug and play widgets that are fully wired up to the ROQ platform APIs.
They are fully functional, and add functionality to your application within just a few lines of code.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  At the moment, ROQ's UI components are available for React only. However, if you need support for other libraries 
like Vue.js or Angular, don't hesitate to contact us on [Slack](http://roqstars.com/).

## Installation

To get started with integrating ROQ UI, you need to wrap your React application into
the [`<RoqProvider/>`](/development-guides/roq-provider).

## Available UI Components

These UI Components are ready to be used in your project!

**Chat system:**

* The [`<Chat/>`](/chat/ui-components#chat) UI component represents the chat message center with sidebar and the chat window.
* The [`<ChatMessageBell/>`](/chat/ui-components#chatmessagebell) component informs the user about unread messages in the chat.

**File management:**

* The [`<FileUpload/>`](/files/ui-components#fileupload) component represents a button which opens a file selector and starts
  uploads.
* The [`<FileDropzone/>`](/files/ui-components#filedropzone) component represents an area on your application where users can drag
  and drop files to be uploaded.
* The [`<FileActiveUploads/>`](/files/ui-components#fileactiveuploads) component shows a progress bar of all active files uploads.
  Users can abort and restart uploads.

**Notifications:**

* The [`<NotificationBell/>`](/notifications/ui-components#notificationbell) component renders a bell symbol which informs the
  user about unread notifications
* The [`<NotificationModal/>`](/notifications/ui-components#notificationmodal) component shows the user's notifications in real-time
  and also enables the user to configure the preferences.

**User invites**

* The [`<UserInvitesTable/>`](/user-invites/ui-components#userinvitestable-) component renders all related components at once. Users
  can invite other users and manage their invitees in a table.
* The [`<UserInviteButton/>`](/user-invites/ui-components#userinvitebutton-) component renders a button which opens a lightbox. The user can then invite other users.
* The [`<UserInvitePane/>`](/user-invites/ui-components#userinvitepane-) component renders a pane that allows to invite one or multiple users at once.
