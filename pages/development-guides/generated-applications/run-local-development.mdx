# Run Local Development 

## Setup & Installation

There are a few steps to run the generated application for local development.

<Steps>
### Setup Environment Variables

To run the generated application locally, you need to copy the environment settings. In the ROQ Console go to the **Application Details** → **Environments** menu and then **Copy Env File** in the **Local Development** section. 

Paste the environment settings into the file `.env` in the root of the generated application project, you need to create this file if it doesn't exist. For instance, `bistro-94be` has these settings:

```dotenv filename=".env"
# .env
# Public variables, used on client - Delete these if you are not using Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROQ_CLIENT_ID=0da52755-06d4-46cf-b64b-c7a433f4f56a
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROQ_PLATFORM_URL=https://qa02.roq-platform.com

# If you change the host or port on your local installation from http://localhost:3000 to another value,
# then you need to update the settings in the console as well. ROQ Console: https://console.roq.tech/
# Modify this to your application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Server variables used for ROQ connection
ROQ_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
ROQ_PLATFORM_URL=https://qa02.roq-platform.com
ROQ_ENVIRONMENT_ID=0da52755-06d4-46cf-b64b-c7a433f4f56a
ROQ_API_KEY=9be9dd8d-371d-4eb4-9cc9-004b214ade4c

# Server variables for ROQ auth
ROQ_SECRET=CHANGE_THIS_SECRET
ROQ_CLIENT_ID=0da52755-06d4-46cf-b64b-c7a433f4f56a
ROQ_CLIENT_SECRET=9be9dd8d-371d-4eb4-9cc9-004b214ade4c
ROQ_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
ROQ_AUTH_LOGIN_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login
ROQ_AUTH_LOGOUT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/logout
ROQ_AUTH_URL=https://0t2xvgrhx2cccakulsofdq8a2.auth.qa02.roq-platform.com

DATABASE_URL=we_will_set_it_later
```


### Install Database

The generated application uses [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) so you can use any database that is supported by Prisma. For this tutorial, we will use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and then we will add `DATABASE_URL` key value in the `env` file.

<Callout type="info">
PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database. You can install the database from this [link](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
</Callout>

To create a database, we will use **pgAdmin**, a bundled GUI application for administering PostgreSQL. Let's call this database a **bistro**.

![pgAdmin](/pgadmin.png)

With the default PostgreSQL installation and with the database name **bistro**, the database URL for the generated application is:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:3113@127.0.0.1/bistro
```
</Steps>

## Run The Application

To run the application type this command in the terminal

```
npm run dev
```

By default, the local application will be running on `http://localhost:3000` and for first-time use, you need to create an account to be able to use the generated application.

If you want the application to run on another port, change the port value in the `.env` file as well as the settings in the ROQ Console and go to the **Application Details** → **Settings**.

![App auth URLs settings](/app-details-callback-settings.png)

Change the port value only, for example, if the port number is `3000`, you can change it to `2112` or any accesible port. Make sure to change **Sign-in URL**, **Allowed Logout URLs**, and **Allowed Callback URLs** and save them.
