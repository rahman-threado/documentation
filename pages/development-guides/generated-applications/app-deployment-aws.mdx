# Application Deployment on AWS

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) or (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. AWS was launched in 2006, and over the years, it has grown to become the leading cloud service provider in the world.

For deploying the ROQ-generated application in AWS, several options are available due to the vast range of cloud computing products offered by AWS. We need two types of services for our generated application:

* **Hosting**: The application can be deployed using Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, or AWS Amplify. Each AWS product has a different workflow for deployment. We will use **AWS Amplify**to ensure simplicity and faster deployment. 

* **Database**: ROQ's generated application default database is PostgreSQL. In AWS, we can use **Amazon RDS** to create the PostgreSQL database.

<Callout type="info">
To follow this tutorial, you should have an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup). AWS also provides [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) for a new user.
</Callout>

We will create the database on Amazon RDS and then deploy the generated application in AWS Amplify.

## Amazon RDS

[Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (Amazon RDS) is a cloud-based database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to make it easier for developers to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. Amazon RDS supports several popular relational database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

By default, ROQ-generated applications use PostgreSQL as the database. We can create and setup the database using Amazon RDS.

<Steps>
### Create PostgreSQL

Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds) for RDS, then click the **Create database** button. This will bring you to the database page:

![create aws postgresql](/aws-rds-postgresql-create.png)

This is a one-long page settings page, so we will only display what has changed while leaving the rest as its default. These are the settings that we modified for the purpose of this tutorial:

- **Engine options**: Choose the **PostgreSQL** database
- **Templates**: Free tier
- **Settings → Db instance identifier**: `animefiguredb`
- **Settings → Master Password**: Manual password entry
- **Connectivity → Public access**: Yes

After creating a database, it will appear in the list of databases in the region where it was created. For example, if the database was created in **us-east-1c** (**N. Virginia**), it will be listed under that region.

![Amazon database list](/aws-rds-database-list.png)

To access the database information, click on the name of the database as it is listed. For example, `animefiguredb`.

### Database Information

The necessary details for establishing a database connection can be found under the **Connectivity & Security** and **Configuration** tabs. Specifically, we require the database URL, endpoint, and port number (the username and password have already been set up).

![Database information](/aws-rds-database-information-con.png)

The security group rules also need to be configured to connect the PostgreSQL database from outside the Amazon Web Services network. 

![rds security rules](/aws-rds-database-information-sec.png)

The **CIDR/IP - Inbound** type with the rule **0.0.0.0/0** allows any traffic from outside the AWS network.  Turning off this rule or limiting it to specific IPs is recommended.

### Connect to Database

The recommended way to connect to Amazon RDS is by using SSL/TLS connections. By default, our database uses a Certificate Authority (CA), which can be found in the **Connectivity & security** tab. 

To connect to the PostgreSQL database outside the network, we must download a certificate bundle to connect to PostgreSQL with Certificate Authority. You can download [certificate bundles for all AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions) or [certificate bundles for specific AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificates).

From our PostgreSQL setup earlier, we have our connection data:

| Parameter           | Value                                                                                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **user**        | `postgres`                                                                                                 |
| **password**        | _Get your saved password or modify the existing password_                                                   |
| **host**             | `animefiguredb.carjebedzjdp.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`                                                   |
| **port**            | `5432`                                                                                                     |
| **dbname**          | `postgres` (the default dbname if it's not set)                                                                            |
| **certificate bundle** | [`us-east-1-bundle.pem`](https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/us-east-1/us-east-1-bundle.pem)    |

Store the certificate bundle `us-east-1-bundle.pem` in an accessible directory. This is only required if connecting to the database outside the AWS network. We can use the `psql` CLI tool to test the database connection:

```shell
psql "postgresql://postgres:password@animefiguredb.carjebedzjdp.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require&sslrootcert=us-east-1-bundle.pem"
```

<Callout type="info">
To develop a generated application locally and want to use a local database, you can read this [database installation](/development-guides/generated-applications/databases-installation) documentation.
</Callout>

### `DATABASE_URL`

ROQ's generated application needs the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to work. Since we already know the connection information, we will set the environment variable:

```ini
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@animefiguredb.carjebedzjdp.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres
```

</Steps>

## AWS Amplify

[AWS Amplify](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify) is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables developers to build and deploy scalable and secure cloud-powered web and mobile applications. Amplify aims to simplify the process of building apps by providing a managed backend for handling authentication, storage, APIs, and other cloud functionalities. Amplify provides two services: **Amplify Hosting** and **Amplify Studio**. For more information about AWS Amplify, please read their [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

## Amplify Hosting

Amplify Hosting is a fully managed hosting service for web apps. Connect a repository to build, deploy, and host the web application.

<Callout type="info">
To include the generated application code in your own GitHub repository, please follow our [tutorial](/development-guides/generated-applications/app-development) on application development.
</Callout>

We need to connect it with a repository to get started with Amplify Hosting. In this tutorial, we will use the GitHub repository. There are a few steps that need to be taken care of:

<Steps>
### Connect to GitHub 

Amplify Hosting provides clear steps to get started on web hosting using GitHub. Choose **GitHub** as the source for the generated application. 

![AWS Amplify GitHub](/aws-ampliy-github.png)

### Select Repository

To use a GitHub repository with Amplify Hosting, first install and authorize AWS Amplify.

![AWS GitHub authorize](/aws-ampliy-github-authorize.png)

We have the option to grant authorization for all repositories or to select a specific repository for better control.

![add repository](/aws-ampliy-github-add-repo.png)

To add a repository branch, select the repository and the branch.

### Build Settings

For our ROQ-generated application, we need the Base URL. Unfortunately, we are unable to determine the URL until the application has been deployed or moved to the build state.

<Callout type="warning">
First time build will fail because we still need to setup the environment variables.
</Callout>

![build failed](/aws-amplify-build-failed.png)

From the build information, we can get the **Domain** or the **Base URL** for our deployed application:

```shell
https://main.d335zd9ekqhkcd.amplifyapp.com
```

#### Set Environment Variables

<Callout type="info">
Read this section first on how to [get the environment variables](/development-guides/generated-applications/app-deployment-aws#roq-environment) from ROQ Console.
</Callout>

In AWS Amplify, navigate to **App settings**, select **Environment variables**, and manually enter variables from ROQ Console or the `.env` file.

![aws amplify build env](/aws-amplify-build-env.png)

And also, add the `DATABASE_URL` from our previous setup:

```ini
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@animefiguredb.carjebedzjdp.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres
```

#### `amplify.yaml`

AWS Amplify has an application build specification that can be edited through **App settings** or overridden by the `amplify.yaml` file. The build specification YML file controls how an app build will run and is stored on the servers.

To edit the build specification in the AWS Amplify, go to **App settings**, select **Build settings**, and edit **App build specification**. 

![build spec](/aws-amplify-build-spec.png)

We can override the AWS Amplify setting above by creating a `amplify.yaml` file on the application project root directory:

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - env | grep -e NEXT_PUBLIC_ROQ_CLIENT_ID -e NEXT_PUBLIC_ROQ_PLATFORM_URL -e NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL >> .env
        - env | grep -e ROQ_BASE_URL -e ROQ_PLATFORM_URL -e ROQ_ENVIRONMENT_ID -e ROQ_API_KEY >> .env
        - env | grep -e ROQ_SECRET -e ROQ_CLIENT_ID -e ROQ_CLIENT_SECRET -e ROQ_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL -e ROQ_AUTH_LOGIN_URL -e ROQ_AUTH_LOGOUT_URL -e ROQ_AUTH_URL -e DATABASE_URL >> .env
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

Please note that environment variables that were previously entered manually are available only in build time. To make the environment variables available in runtime, we need to save the environment variables into a `.env` file.

```bash
env | grep -e NEXT_PUBLIC_ROQ_CLIENT_ID -e NEXT_PUBLIC_ROQ_PLATFORM_URL -e NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL >> .env
```

<Callout type="info">
Amplify Hosting supports adding environment variables to your application's builds by setting them in the project's configuration in the Amplify console. However, a Next.js server component cannot access those environment variables by default. For more information, please read it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/ssr-environment-variables.html).
</Callout>

### Redeploy Application

After the environment variables are setup, we can redeploy the application in Amplify Hosting. Click the application name. For example, `anime-figure-store`:

![aws amplify main branch](/aws-amplify-build-main.png)

Click the branch `main` that will bring us to the branch build details.

![aws amplify main branch deploy](/aws-amplify-build-deploy.png)

Click the **Redeploy this version** button to build and redeploy.

### Test Application

To test the application, open the browser and go to the URL:

```shell
https://main.d335zd9ekqhkcd.amplifyapp.com/
```

![aws amplify deploy URL](/aws-amplify-deployed-url.png)

Sign up to the deployed application, and every time, we make a changes to the source code and then push it to the GitHub repository. AWS Amplify Hosting will pick up the changes and build the new version of the application. 

</Steps>

## ROQ Environment

The ROQ-generated application will work as expected if we configure the right environment settings. You must create a new environment on [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/).

<ROQEnv/>

![AWS amplify roq env](/aws-ampliy-roq-env.png)

We can call the new environment anything, for example, **Amazon AWS**. Later, we need to configure the base URL for the deployed application.

We already have information for the Base URL from our Amplify Hosting build. In the ROQ Console, go to the **Application Details** → **Settings** to configure the environment variables.

![ROQ ](/aws-amplify-roq-env.png)

We need to setup the **Base URL** and all the **Authentication URLs**. 

| Description            | URL                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Base URL               | `https://main.d335zd9ekqhkcd.amplifyapp.com`         |
| Sign-in URL            | `https://main.d335zd9ekqhkcd.amplifyapp.com/api/auth/login` |
| Allowed Logout URLs    | `https://main.d335zd9ekqhkcd.amplifyapp.com/api/auth/logout` |
| Allowed Callback URLs  | `https://main.d335zd9ekqhkcd.amplifyapp.com/api/auth/callback` |


Click the **Copy Env File** button to copy the environment variables and save them in a `.env` file in the application project root.

## Troubleshooting

Please check the compute logs if the deployed application is not running as expected, such as an `Internal Server Error`. On AWS Amplify, go to the **App settings**, then select **Monitoring**, and finally select **Hosting compute logs**.
