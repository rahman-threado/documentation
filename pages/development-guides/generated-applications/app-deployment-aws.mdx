# Application Deployment on AWS

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) or (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. AWS was launched in 2006, and over the years, it has grown to become the leading cloud service provider in the world.

For deploying the ROQ-generated application in AWS, there are several options available due to the vast range of cloud computing products offered by AWS. The application can be deployed using Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, or AWS Amplify. Each AWS product has a different workflow for deployment. To ensure simplicity and faster deployment, we will use AWS Amplify.
