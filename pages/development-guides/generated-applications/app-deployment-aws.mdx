# Application Deployment on AWS

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) or (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. AWS was launched in 2006, and over the years, it has grown to become the leading cloud service provider in the world.

For deploying the ROQ-generated application in AWS, there are several options available due to the vast range of cloud computing products offered by AWS. We need two type services for our generated application:

* **Hosting**: The application can be deployed using Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, or AWS Amplify. Each AWS product has a different workflow for deployment. To ensure simplicity and faster deployment, we will use **AWS Amplify**. 

* **Database**: ROQ's generated application default database is PostgreSQL. In AWS we can use **Amazon RDS** to create the PostgreSQL database.

You should have an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) to follow this tutorial. AWS also provide [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) for a new user.
</Callout>

We will create the database first on Amazon RDS and then deploying the generated application in AWS Amplify.

## Amazon RDS

[Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (Amazon RDS) is a cloud-based database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to make it easier for developers to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. Amazon RDS offers support for several popular relational database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

There are a few steps to create a PostgreSQL database in Amazon RDS:

<Steps>
### Create PostgreSQL

Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds) for RDS then click the **Create database** button. This will bring you to the database page:

 <Callout type="info">
This is a one-long page settings page, so we will only display what has changed while leaving the rest as its default.
</Callout>

These are the settings that we modified for the purpose of this tutorial:

- **Engine options**: Choose the **PostgreSQL** database
- **Templates**: Free tier
- **Settings → Db instance identifier**: `animefiguredb`
- **Settings → Master Password**: Manual password entry
- **Connectivity → Public access**: Yes

After creating a database, it will appear in the list of databases in the region where it was created. For example, if the database was created in **us-east-1c** (**N. Virginia**), it will be listed under that region.

### Test Connection

To connect PostgreSQL database from the local computer or outside the Amazon Web Services network, we need to configure security group rules.



</Steps>
## AWS Amplify

[AWS Amplify](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify) is a services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables developers to build and deploy scalable and secure cloud-powered web and mobile applications. Amplify aims to simplify the process of building apps by providing a managed backend for handling authentication, storage, APIs, and other cloud functionalities. Amplify provides two services: **Amplify Hosting** and **Amplify Studio**. For more information about AWS Amplify, please read their [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/).
