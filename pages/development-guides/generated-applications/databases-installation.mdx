# Database Installation

ROQ offers a managed database service that can be used even for local development requirements. By default, ROQ provides managed PostgreSQL as a database solution, which can be used as is or you can set up your own database locally. If you prefer to use PostgreSQL locally or any other database, please refer to the documentation below for further guidance.
