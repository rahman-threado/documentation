# Database Installation

ROQ already provides a managed database even for local development purposes. The default database that ROQ provides is PostgreSQL. You can use this database or setup your own locally. 

<Callout type="info">
The database URL is set in the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. You will find the database variable and other required environment variables on the ROQ Console **Get Started** page or **Application Details** page. 
</Callout>

## PostgreSQL

To integrate ROQ's generated application with a PostgreSQL database, please refer to this [guide](/development-guides/database/postgresql) on installation and usage.
