# Application Deployment on Heroku

ROQ's generated application can be deployed to many platform such as Vercel, Amazon AWS, or Google Cloud Platform, etc. and this guide will explain how to deploy the generated application on Heroku.

## Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It was one of the first cloud platforms and has become popular for its ease of use, simplicity, and developer-friendly features as well as programming languages support.

<Callout type="info">
You need to add a verified payment method if you intend to try Heroku because it doesn't provide free tiers.
</Callout>

There are a few steps that should be done before deploying our generated application into Heroku.

<Steps>
### Create Heroku Account

If you don't have an existing account, create a Heroku account by signup [here](https://signup.heroku.com/). 

### Create New Projects

<Callout type="info">
To create a new application with the help of the ROQ AI assistant, simply head over to [app.roq.ai](https://app.roq.ai/).
</Callout>

We will use the generated application in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/roq-ai/anime-scaled-fig-2d3f) as an example. To host our generated application on Heroku, you can create a new project in two ways:

#### Heroku Dashboard 
 
Using [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) is the easiest way to start a new project. It's using web user interfaces.

#### Heroku CLI

The [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) or `heroku` command-line interface (CLI) is a tool that makes any Heroku-related task right from the terminal. To install `heroku` please go to their [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli).

Before using this CLI tool, you need to be authenticated first. You can run `heroku` with the `login` option:

```shell
$ heroku login

heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/e4f42c4d?requestor=SFMyNTY
Logging in... done
Logged in as han+solo@gmail.com
```

And then to create a new project from Heroku CLI:

```shell
$ heroku create anime-figure-store

Creating â¬¢ anime-figure-store... done
https://anime-figure-store-d294970a1217.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/anime-figure-store.git
```
This process is the same with creating a project with Heroku Dashboard and from now on we will use Heroku CLI as our main deployment tool.

### Deploying Generated Application

Currently there are three different deployment methods to Heroku

| Deployment Method  | Description                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Git repository     | Deploy git repositories using Heroku CLI.   |
| GitHub             | Deploy automatically using GitHub.          |
| Container Registry | Deploy Docker-based application.            |

For simplicity, we will use the **Git repository** method for deployment the generated application to Heroku.

#### Git Repository

If you already have an application, you can clone it from the GitHub repository. For our example, we will clone it to the local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:roq-ai/anime-scaled-fig-2d3f.git
```

In order to deploy existing repositories, we need to add Heroku as the target remote repository.

<Callout type="info">
To use your own GitHub repository and run a local development, please read this [documentation](/development-guides/generated-applications/app-development) and [this](/development-guides/generated-applications/run-local-development).
</Callout>

Suppose we are already in the generated application root directory source code, to add Heroku as the remote repository, run this command:

```shell
$ heroku git:remote -a anime-figure-store
```

If everything set it right, you will see that our local git repository will have **heroku** as the remote target:

```shell
set git remote heroku to https://git.heroku.com/anime-figure-store.git
```

before we push our application code into Heroku, we need to setup environment configuration on ROQ Console.


#### ROQ Console Environments 

For a better management, we need to create a new environment in ROQ Console for the Heroku deployment. 

<ROQEnv/>
