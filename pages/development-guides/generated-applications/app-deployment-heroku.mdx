# Application Deployment on Heroku

ROQ's generated application can be deployed to many platforms, such as Vercel, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, etc., and this guide will explain how to deploy the generated application on Heroku.

## Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It was one of the first cloud platforms and has become popular for its ease of use, simplicity, developer-friendly features, and programming language support.

<Callout type="info">
You need to add a verified payment method if you intend to try Heroku because it doesn't provide free tiers.
</Callout>

A few steps should be done before deploying our generated application into Heroku.

<Steps>
### Create a Heroku Account

If you don't have an existing account, create a Heroku account by signup [here](https://signup.heroku.com/). 

### Create New Projects

<Callout type="info">
To create a new application with the help of the ROQ AI assistant, simply head over to [app.roq.ai](https://app.roq.ai/).
</Callout>

We will use the generated application in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/roq-ai/anime-scaled-fig-2d3f) as an example. To host our generated application on Heroku, you can create a new project in two ways:

#### Heroku Dashboard 
 
Using [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) is the easiest way to start a new project. It uses web user interfaces. 

![heroku add new app](/heroku-new-app.png)

#### Heroku CLI

The [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) or `heroku` command-line interface (CLI) is a tool that makes any Heroku-related task right from the terminal. To install `heroku`, please go to their [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli).

Before using this CLI tool, you need to be authenticated first. You can run `heroku` with the `login` option:

```shell
$ heroku login

heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/e4f42c4d?requestor=SFMyNTY
Logging in... done
Logged in as han+solo@gmail.com
```

And then to create a new project from Heroku CLI:

```shell
$ heroku create anime-figure-store

Creating ⬢ anime-figure-store... done
https://anime-figure-store-d294970a1217.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/anime-figure-store.git
```
This process is the same as creating a project with Heroku Dashboard, and from now on, we will use Heroku CLI as our main deployment tool.

### Deploying Generated Application

Currently, there are three different deployment methods for Heroku.

| Deployment Method  | Description                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Git repository     | Deploy git repositories using Heroku CLI.   |
| GitHub             | Deploy automatically using GitHub.          |
| Container Registry | Deploy Docker-based application.            |

For simplicity, we will use the **Git repository** method for the deployment of the generated application to Heroku

#### Git Repository

If you already have an application, you can clone it from the GitHub repository. For our example, we will clone it to the local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:roq-ai/anime-scaled-fig-2d3f.git
```

In order to deploy existing repositories, we need to add Heroku as the target remote repository.

<Callout type="info">
To use your own GitHub repository and run a local development, please read this [documentation](/development-guides/generated-applications/app-development) and [this](/development-guides/generated-applications/run-local-development).
</Callout>

Suppose we are already in the generated application root directory source code. To add Heroku as the remote repository, run this command:

```shell
$ heroku git:remote -a anime-figure-store
```

If everything is set right, you will see that our local git repository will have **heroku** as the remote target:

```shell
set git remote heroku to https://git.heroku.com/anime-figure-store.git
```

Before we push our application code into Heroku, we need to set the environment configuration on the ROQ Console.


#### ROQ Console Environments 

For better management, we need to create a new environment in the ROQ Console for the Heroku deployment.

<ROQEnv/>

![heroku new env](/heroku-new-env.png)

Next, we need to set the base URL for the Heroku application in the ROQ Console. We can find this URL in the Heroku Dashboard domains setting page or using Heroku CLI:

```shell
$ heroku domains
```

The command will output all domains attached to the app. For the first-time application setup, this command will return the default URL created by Heroku. For example:

```shell
=== anime-figure-store Heroku Domain

anime-figure-store-3e469cbd65b3.herokuapp.com
```

We need to set this base URL in the ROQ Console application settings. Go to the ROQ Console and find **Application Details** ➔ **Settings** menu.

![roq console app settings](/heroku-set-env.png)

You need to configure these two main settings:

- **Base URL**: `https://anime-figure-store-3e469cbd65b3.herokuapp.com`

- **Authentication URLs**: `https://[base_url_heroku]/api/auth/[action]`

Click **Copy Env File** button to copy new environment variables for Heroku deployment. Paste them into the `.env` file in the app's root directory.


#### Heroku PostgreSQL

ROQ's generated application needs PostgreSQL by default, and Heroku already provides an add-on. Go to the **Resources** tab in the Heroku Dashboard and find "PostgreSQL" from Heroku.

![PostgreSQL addon](/heroku-add-postgresql.png)

Click the **Submit Order Form** button, and Heroku will automatically setup the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in the dashboard settings.

![PostgreSQL Heroku env](/heroku-add-postgresql-env.png)

#### Heroku Environments

Heroku's **Config Vars** are equivalent to environment variables. However, setting environment variables on Heroku can be tedious since it must be done one at a time. 

We can set the environment variables manually or create automated scripts for that. For example, to automate it using Node.js:

```js
// set-heroku-env.js
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Read the .env file
const envFile = path.join(__dirname, '.env');
const envVariables = fs.readFileSync(envFile, 'utf8').split('\n');

let command = 'heroku config:set';

envVariables.forEach((line) => {
  // Filter out comments and empty lines
  if (line && !line.startsWith('#')) {
    command += ` ${line}`;
  }
});

// Set the Heroku config variables in one command
exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error setting variables: ${error}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Set variables:');
  console.log(`STDOUT: ${stdout}`);
  console.log(`STDERR: ${stderr}`);
});  
```
Then, we can run it in the root project folder (where the `.env` resides). The script will set config var in Heroku one by one:

```shell
$ node set-heroku-env.js
```


#### Push the code

The last step is to push the generated application code into the Heroku repository. This command will automatically build the generated application on Heroku:

```shell
$ git push heroku main
```

### ROQ on Heroku

If everything is set up correctly, we can run the installation test for our application on Heroku. We can use `heroku` to directly open the deployed application.

```shell
$ heroku open
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

Suppose the generated application database schema is not deployed correctly on PostgreSQL. In that case, we can re-run `prisma migrate` using Heroku CLI. For example: 

```shell
$ heroku run "prisma migrate deploy" --app anime-figure-store
```
