# Application Deployment on GCP

## Google Cloud Platform

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, YouTube, and Google Drive.

Deploying the generated application with a PostgreSQL database on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) involves multiple steps, including setting up a PostgreSQL database on Cloud SQL and deploying the Next.js app on a service like Google App Engine or Google Cloud Run. 

There are so many ways to deploy application on Google Cloud Platform. In this tutorial we will use **Google App Engine** and **Google Cloud SQL**. Below is a guide on how to do this.

<Callout type="info">
The **Billing** features need to be enabled to use the Google Cloud Platform. Basically you need a valid payment method even for [free trial period](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-trial). Go [here](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs) for further explanation.

## `gcloud`

The [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/cli) or `gcloud` is a set of tools to create and manage Google Cloud resources. You can use these tools to perform many common platform tasks from the command line or through scripts and other automation.

We will use `gcloud` on Windows OS. For another operating system please download Google Cloud CLI from this [link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

The installation in Windows is straightforward and in the end of installation it will help us to use an existing or creating a new Google Cloud project. 

For example, if we want to connect the generated application with a Google Cloud project. For this scenario, we can use the `gcloud init` command on the root application:

```shell
PS E:\_workspaces\ROQ\anime-scaled-fig-2d3f-v3> gcloud init
Welcome! This command will take you through the configuration of gcloud.

Settings from your current configuration [default] are:
accessibility:
  screen_reader: 'False'
core:
  account: anna.w@gmail.com
  disable_usage_reporting: 'True'
  project: roq-project

Pick configuration to use:
 [1] Re-initialize this configuration [default] with new settings
 [2] Create a new configuration
Please enter your numeric choice:  1

Your current configuration has been set to: [default]

You can skip diagnostics next time by using the following flag:
  gcloud init --skip-diagnostics

Network diagnostic detects and fixes local network connection issues.
Checking network connection...done.
Reachability Check passed.
Network diagnostic passed (1/1 checks passed).

Choose the account you would like to use to perform operations for this configuration:
 [1] anna.w@gmail.com
 [2] Log in with a new account
Please enter your numeric choice:  1

You are logged in as: [anna.w@gmail.com].

This account has no projects.

Would you like to create one? (Y/n)?  y

Enter a Project ID. Note that a Project ID CANNOT be changed later.
Project IDs must be 6-30 characters (lowercase ASCII, digits, or
hyphens) in length and start with a lowercase letter. anime-figure-store
Waiting for [operations/cp.6165428578280918017] to finish...done.
Your current project has been set to: [anime-figure-store].
```

If we don't have a Google Cloud project or we don't want to use the existing one, the `gcloud` will offer us to create a new Google project.

## Google Cloud SQL

[Google Cloud SQL](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/) offers a fully-managed database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

### How to Create a PostgreSQL Database?

<Steps>
### Go to Google Cloud SQL

Sign-in to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and navigate to **SQL** menu in the left sidebar or directly go [here]((https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/)).

### Create PostgreSQL Instance

Click Create instance, then select the **PostgreSQL** database engine.

![PostgreSQL instance](/google-cloud-sql-postgre.png)

<Callout type="info">
In order to create an instance, you have to enable the Compute Engine API first. Google Cloud Console will provide you with the **Enable API** button.
</Callout>

### PostgreSQL Configuration 

Configure the database settings, such as version, region, and password based on the needs.

![PostgreSQL instance configuration](/google-cloud-sql-postgre-config.png)

There are some mandatory fields that need to be filled. For example, the generated application is about **Anime Figure Store** we can fill the fields:

- **Instance ID**: `animefigurestore`
- **Password**: We can fill anything or generate the password.
- **Database Version**: Default is the latest.

The Cloud SQL edition, preset, region, and availability are configurable. Choose as per your needs.

### `DATABASE_URL`

After creating, take note of the connection credentials and IP address, as you'll need them to connect to the database.
