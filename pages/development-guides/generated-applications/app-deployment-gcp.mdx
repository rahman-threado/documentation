# Application Deployment on GCP

## Google Cloud Platform

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, YouTube, and Google Drive.

Deploying the generated application with a PostgreSQL database on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) involves multiple steps, including setting up a PostgreSQL database on Cloud SQL and deploying the Next.js app on a service like Google App Engine or Google Cloud Run. TheBelow is a guide on how to do this.

## `gcloud`

The [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/cli) or `gcloud` is a set of tools to create and manage Google Cloud resources. You can use these tools to perform many common platform tasks from the command line or through scripts and other automation.

We will use `gcloud` on Windows OS. For another operating system please download from this [link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
