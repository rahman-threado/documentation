# Sync User Data with Database

## Introduction

Synchronizing user data ensures users have a consistent view of their information, preferences, and progress across all platforms. There are many ways to to synchronize data from ROQ to another application which essentially synchronize necessary data in the third party application database with ROQ application.

ROQ provides APIs for easy data query and management and a [Webhook](/development-guides/webhooks) to notify the application when an event happens in the account. We can use this feature to sync the user data with third-party applications. Webhooks are more real-time than periodic API polling, but they also require third-party apps to have an endpoint to receive the data.

## Sync Case

Let's consider an example of an application created by ROQ that collects figurines. In this application, users typically add and remove images of their collectible figurines. If we connect this application with a third-party application, any updates made to the files in the ROQ application will also be reflected in the third-party application. For this to be possible, we need to synchronize the data between the two applications.

We will use ROQ's webhook to notify third-party applications of events. For instance, when a user adds a new item to their collection, the webhook can notify the third-party app. 

### ROQ Webhook

To use ROQ Webhook. we should enable the webhook feature. Go to the ROQ Console and **Application Details**, select **Settings** and find **Webhook** section. Tick mark both **Create** and **Update** for **Files**.

<Callout type="info">
Make sure to provide a valid webhook URL that can receive and process these messages. Note that the URL should be publicly accessible and secure, as sensitive information may be included in the notifications.
</Callout>

For this tutorial, we will only be using the webhook for file updates and creations. If you wish to configure it for user and chat activity, you can do so. Any user activity related to files will trigger the system to send a message to the specified webhook.

ROQ Webhook will send post data to the webhook URL. For example, the webhook payload data for file updates in JSON:

```json
{
	"name": "ROQ_FILE_UPDATE",
	"id": "6c64b15f-30f4-4340-8269-6e01038cb610",
	"object": "file",
	"data": {
		"current": {
			"id": "6c64b15f-30f4-4340-8269-6e01038cb610",
			"name": "Default_3D_character_Has_black_hairee0c-33b0_1.jpg",
			"status": "ready",
			"createdByUserId": "8d18aea8-65a4-4539-b202-8cf44688fa86",
			"isPublic": true,
			"contentType": "image/jpeg",
			"fileCategoryId": "1ebfb78e-5b26-40b2-95a5-b0e001aab658",
			"createdAt": "2023-09-19T11:31:45.537Z",
			"updatedAt": "2023-09-19T11:31:47.394Z"
		},
		"previous": {
			"id": "6c64b15f-30f4-4340-8269-6e01038cb610",
			"name": "3D_character_Has_black_hair_ca_1.jpg",
			"status": "upload_pending",
			"createdByUserId": "8d18aea8-65a4-4539-b202-8cf44688fa86",
			"isPublic": true,
			"contentType": "image/jpeg",
			"fileCategoryId": "1ebfb78e-5b26-40b2-95a5-b0e001aab658",
			"createdAt": "2023-09-19T11:31:45.537Z",
			"updatedAt": "2023-09-19T11:31:45.537Z",
		}
	},
	"environmentId": "051528ea-fcfc-4c6f-a749-e3d21af37127"
}
```

This JSON payload gives us a lot of information about which user updates the file and the changing file information. With this information, we can query necessary data from ROQ and update data in the third-party application database.

### Webhook Server

It's important to note that numerous solutions are available for webhook automation, including building your own or utilizing automation services. However, we will create a basic webhook server using Node.js for this tutorial.

Please keep in mind that the webhook endpoint on this server needs to be publicly accessible and have a secure connection in order for the payload data to be delivered successfully. To make the URL publicly available for development purposes, you can use a tunneling service like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and then set the webhook URL in the ROQ Console.  

The webhook server using **sqlite** database to synchronize the updated files from ROQ's generated application. Of course in the production you can use another database to suit your business needs. 


```js
import 'dotenv/config'
import express from 'express'
import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'
import { dirname } from 'path'

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const __dirname = dirname(__filename)
const app = express()

// Initialize SQLite database
const db = new sqlite3.Database(`${__dirname}/myfigurine.sqlite`)

db.serialize(() => {
	const createTableQuery = `
	  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS figurine (
		id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
		name TEXT,
		status TEXT,
		createdByUserId TEXT,
		isPublic INTEGER,
		contentType TEXT,
		fileCategoryId TEXT,
		createdAt TEXT,
		updatedAt TEXT
	  );`

	db.run(createTableQuery, (err) => {
		if (err) {
			console.log('Table creation failed:', err)
		} else {
			console.log('Table created successfully')
		}
	})
})

app.use(express.json())

const handleRoqWebhook = (req, res) => {
	const payload = req.body
	const eventName = payload.name

	if (eventName === 'ROQ_FILE_UPDATE') {
		const fileData = payload.data.current
		const previousFileData = payload.data.previous
		// Update the database
		upsertDatabase(fileData, previousFileData)
	}

	console.log('Received ROQ payload:', payload)
	res.status(200).send('OK')
}

const upsertDatabase = (currentData) => {
	const query = `
		INSERT INTO figurine (
			id, name, status, createdByUserId, isPublic, 
			contentType, fileCategoryId, createdAt, updatedAt
		)
		VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
		ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE SET
			name = excluded.name,
			status = excluded.status,
			createdByUserId = excluded.createdByUserId,
			isPublic = excluded.isPublic,
			contentType = excluded.contentType,
			fileCategoryId = excluded.fileCategoryId,
			createdAt = excluded.createdAt,
			updatedAt = excluded.updatedAt;`

	const values = [
		currentData.id,
		currentData.name,
		currentData.status,
		currentData.createdByUserId,
		currentData.isPublic ? 1 : 0,
		currentData.contentType,
		currentData.fileCategoryId,
		currentData.createdAt,
		currentData.updatedAt
	]

	db.run(query, values, function (err) {
		if (err) {
			console.log('Database upsert failed:', err)
			return
		}
		console.log(`Database upserted, row(s) affected: ${this.changes}`)
	})
}

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
	res.status(200).send({ server: "webhook" })
})
app.post('/roq-webhook', handleRoqWebhook)

app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
	console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${process.env.PORT}`)
})
```

To optimize the handling of file creation and update activity. It is imperative to filter data using `event.name` parameter with a value of `ROQ_FILE_UPDATE`. This approach ensures that the webhook server processes only the relevant data.

The payload data from the ROQ system then can be used to update the existing record on the database or create a new record. Hence, creating a synchronization process.

```js
const query = `
		INSERT INTO figurine (
			id, name, status, createdByUserId, isPublic, 
			contentType, fileCategoryId, createdAt, updatedAt
		)
		VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
		ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE SET
			name = excluded.name,
			status = excluded.status,
			createdByUserId = excluded.createdByUserId,
			isPublic = excluded.isPublic,
			contentType = excluded.contentType,
			fileCategoryId = excluded.fileCategoryId,
			createdAt = excluded.createdAt,
			updatedAt = excluded.updatedAt;`
```

Based on the payload, we can query another data from ROQ platform. Such as query the URL for the updated file.

```graphql
query files(
  $filter: FileFilterArgType = {
    id: { equalTo: "6c64b15f-30f4-4340-8269-6e01038cb610" }
  }
) {
  files(filter: $filter) {
    totalCount
    data {
      id
      name
      url
    }
  }
}
```






{/**Add exposing the server to public so it can pickup the payload */}
