# Sync User Data with Database

## Introduction

Synchronizing user data ensures users have a consistent view of their information, preferences, and progress across all platforms. ROQ provides APIs for easy data query and management and a webhook to notify the application when an event happens in the account. We can use this feature to sync the user data with third-party applications.

## Objectives

For this tutorial, we will sync user file data from the ROQ platform to a third-party web application using ROQ's [Webhook](/development-guides/webhooks) feature.

Sync files between local database (or app) and files in the ROQ platform

User Collections:

Sync Case: Users might have the ability to manage their collections on multiple devices or platforms (web, mobile, third-party apps).

Database Interaction: Sync user collection data across these platforms to ensure a consistent view and management experience.

Applications:

- ROQ's generated application connect to Zapier via ROQ Webhook. Sync files between ROQ and third party tools.

Webhooks:

Method: Use webhooks to notify third-party applications of events within your SaaS. For instance, when a user adds a new item to their collection, the webhook can notify the third-party app.

Consideration: Webhooks are more real-time than periodic API polling, but they also require third-party apps to have an endpoint to receive the data.
