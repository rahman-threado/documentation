# Using ROQ with MongodDB

This documentation explains how to integrate ROQ's generated application with MongoDB and install MongoDB on different operating systems and container-based solutions such as Docker.

## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a type of database known as NoSQL. It stores data in BSON format, which is similar to JSON and is designed for storing data in key-value pairs. MongoDB is popular in JavaScript application development because its document model is easily mappable to objects in application code. Additionally, it includes built-in support for high availability and horizontal scaling, making it a reliable choice for large-scale applications.

MongoDB is a database that stores data in collections without requiring a schema to be defined beforehand, unlike in a relational database where you need to define tables. The structure of each collection can also be modified over time, making it easy to iterate your data model.

To install MongoDB in your operating system, please follow the documentation below:
