# How to Add a New Notification

Establishing notifications is a crucial aspect of any successful software application. Notifications engage users and
keep them informed about important updates, events, or required actions. With ROQ Platform, you can add a new
notification to your project through a straightforward process.

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to add a new notification to your project using ROQ's user interface.

## Selecting the Project

Begin by selecting the specific project and environment on the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) for which you
want to create a new notification. Make sure to choose the appropriate **project** and **environment** before
proceeding.

![Select project and environment](/select-project-and-env.png)

## Accessing the Notifications Settings Page

To access the notifications settings page in the ROQ console, click the Notifications menu (represented by a bell icon).
On this page, you will see a list of notification templates for the current project.

## Creating a New Notification Template

To create a new notification template, click the **Templates** menu, then locate and click the **Create Template**
button. This action will initiate the process of creating a new notification template, enabling you to customize the
notification according to your project's needs.

![Create notifications template](/create-notifications-template.png)

When creating a new notification template, you need to fill in two fields:

1. **Key**: Each template requires a unique key, which will be used as a reference to trigger notifications using the
   API or programmatically.
2. **Notification Description**: This is where you describe the notification.

After creating a notification template, you will need to configure and activate the channels. Currently, we support
three channels: Web (In-App), Email, and SMS.

![Configure template](/configure-template.png)

Each of these channels allows you to configure message templates.

![Configure messages](/configure-messages-on-channel.png)

Please note that for the **Email** and **SMS** channels to work, you need to set up ROQ with third-party services first
in the [Integration](/mails/integration) ROQ Console.

To create localized content for the channel messages, click **Create Localized Content** button. Fill in the fields to
your needs and save it.

![Create localized content](/cretae-localized-content.png)

The localized content supports custom variables, enabling you to notify users with custom values in the message.

<Callout type="info">
Some default variables are always passed to the template, such as `recipient.firstName`, `recipient.lastName`, and `APPLICATION_URL`. Read this [section](/notifications/api#default-variables) for more details.
</Callout>

For example, if we create a template with a custom variable `downloadLink`:

![Localized content with vars](/localized-content-with-vars.png)

You can set the `downloadLink` variable with Notification API or by query via GraphQL API. For instance, using Node.js
and GraphQL:

{/* TODO: explain about default vars that always shown in the notifications */}

<Tabs items={['Node.js SDK', 'GraphQL']}>
<Tab>

```ts filename="add-notification-example.js"
import { Platform } from '@roq/nodejs'
 
/**
 * Connect to the ROQ Platform
 */
const client = new Platform({
	apiKey: process.env.ROQ_API_KEY,
	environmentId: process.env.ROQ_ENVIRONMENT_ID,
	host: process.env.ROQ_PLATFORM_URL
})

await client.asSuperAdmin().notify({
    notification: {
        key: 'notification_key_template_here',
        recipients: {
            userIds: ['abc123'],
            userGroups: {operator: 'AND', userGroupIds: ['xyz789']},
            excludedUserIds: ['abc123'],
            allUsers: false,
        },
        data: [{key: 'downloadLink', value: 'https://youtubiah-8b47.vercel.app/file/youfile.zip'}],
    },
});
```

</Tab><Tab>

```graphql
mutation {
  notify(
    notification: {
      key: "notification_key_template_here"
      recipients: {
        userIds: ["abc123"]
        userGroups: { operator: AND, userGroupIds: ["xyz789"] }
        excludedUserIds: ["abc123"]
        allUsers: false
      }
      data: [{ key: "downloadLink", value: "https://youtubiah-8b47.vercel.app/file/youfile.zip" }]
    }
  ) {
    usersNotified {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

To test the notification read this [tutorial](/notifications/tutorials/test-notification) and if you want to learn more
about the Notification API, please go [here](/notifications/api).

After **Create Localized Content** for any channels that you need, the notification will show up on **Notifications
Preferences** in your SaaS project.
