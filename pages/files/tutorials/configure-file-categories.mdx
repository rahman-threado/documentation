### Configure File Categories

Each uploaded file belongs to a file category, which you can configure in ROQ Console. Go to the **File Handling** âž” **Categories** menu. 

File categories have two purposes:

* Fetch files by categories (e.g. _get all avatars_).
* Define the maximum file size of uploaded files.

If you create a new category, you need to input these **required** fields:

* **Name**: The name of the category.
* **Key**: The key for the category. You will use it when uploading the file.
* **Max file Size**: Maximum file size.
* **Unit**: You can choose **MB** for Megabyte or **GB** for Gigabyte.

There is no strict rule for the key naming system as long as it maintains consistency. For example, the key name `USER_FILES` is a good illustration.
