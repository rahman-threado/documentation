# Social Sign-ins

## Introduction

ROQ supports various social sign-ins like Google, Facebook, Github, and LinkedIn. You can activate and configure them in ROQ Console and go to **Authentication** âž” **Social Sign-in** or [here](https://console.roq.tech/settings/authentication-form/social-signin).

## Google

### ROQ Social Sign-in

To enable Google OAuth login, follow this [documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en). For most social sign-ins, you need to set up these two credentials on ROQ Console:

* **Client ID**: Client ID for Web application

* **Client Secret**: Client Secret for Web application

### Google OAuth 

In the Google OAuth setting page, you need to set these two mandatory fields:

#### Authorized Redirect URIs 

Users will be redirected to this path after they have authenticated with Google. Fill this with **Auth Redirect URI** from the ROQ Social Sign-in page.

```shell
https://2d8rgp5gn9qjobt4wfrraicmc.auth.jupiter-pp.roq-platform.com/oauth/google/redirect
```

#### Authorized JavaScript Origins

The HTTP origins that host your web application. This value can't contain wildcards or paths. The value must be the authentication hostname of the environment: 

```shell
https://<prefix>.auth.jupiter-pp.roq-platform.com
```

That is:

```shell
https://2d8rgp5gn9qjobt4wfrraicmc.auth.jupiter-pp.roq-platform.com
```
The settings for both options are displayed in the screenshot below.

Once activated, Google Sign-in can be used as a registration or login option. The next step is add this Google Sign-in into the registration form.

## How to Add Social Sign-in

Before adding social sign-ins to the registration or login form, make sure to activate and configure them. For example, for Google OAuth, you can check out the previous documentation [section](/authentication/social-sign-ins#google).

To add Google Sign-In to the login form, enable it, and don't forget to click the **Save** button to save the settings.
