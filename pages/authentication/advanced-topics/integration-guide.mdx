# Authentication Integration Guide

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
This page describes how to add ROQ's authentication to an existing app.   
If you use [ROQ's AI Assistant](https://app.roq.ai/) to generate your SaaS application,
the full authentication is already up and running, and nothing needs to be done. 
</Callout>

## Introduction

In these getting-started guide you will learn how to level-up your web application with ROQ's advanced authentication
and user management capabilties.

## (1) Install NPM packages

Install the following package(s) into your project:

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'Express.js']}><Tab>

```shell
npm install @roq/nextjs
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```shell
npm install @roq/expressjs
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## (2) Setup credentials

{/* TODO https://roqtech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/705232897/ROQ+Auth+Doc#(2)-Credentials */}

Login to [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/), copy the needed credentials and paste them into the `.env` file of
your web application. You need to add the `ROQ_SECRET` variable. The value can be generated by
running `openssl rand -hex 32` on the
command line.

You can read more about the credentials [here](/authentication/advanced-topics/configuration).

## (3) Add routes for authentication

ROQ provides a wrapper which adds these four routes into your application: `/login`, `/logout`, `/session` and
`/callback`. You can read more about them [here](/authentication/advanced-topics/authentication-routes).

{/* TODO Install roq next.js */}

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'Express.js']}><Tab>

Create a new file: `pages/api/[...roqAuth].ts` with this content. Next.js will automatically detect and import the
handler.

```typescript
import { RoqAuth } from "@roq/nextjs";

export default RoqAuth;
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
Import `auth` middleware and register it in your Express.js server. Middleware will automatically register new
routes.

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { auth } from "@roq/expressjs";

const app = express();
app.use(auth());
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## (4) Protect frontend pages

You can use `requireNextAuth` to wrap non-public pages of your application. This disallowes non-authenticated users to open
the page and redirects them to the login-page.

<Tabs items={['Next.js']}><Tab>

```tsx
import { requireNextAuth } from "@roq/nextjs";

const MyPage = function () {
  return <Content>...</Content>;
};

export default requireNextAuth({
  redirectIfAuthenticated: true,
  redirectTo: "/login",
})(MyPage);
```

</Tab></Tabs>

## (5) Protect APIs

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'Express.js']}><Tab>
On the server-side you can wrap your API handler with the `withAuth` function to enforce authentication. The function
throws an unauthorized error if the user is not authenticated.

```tsx
import { withAuth } from "@roq/nextjs";

async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const session = getServerSession(req);
  const user = session.user;
}

export default function apiHandler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  return withAuth(req, res)(handler);
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
On the server-side you can wrap your API handler with the `requireAuth` middleware to enforce authentication. The function
throws an unauthorized error if the user is not authenticated.

```tsx
import { requireAuth } from "@roq/expressjs";
import { Router } from "express";

const router = new Router();

router.get("/", requireAuth);
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## What's next

🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 That’s it! You successfully protected your application. Give it a try and register a new user. Of course, you can
individualize your authentication even further: [Feature Overview](/authentication#feature-overview).
