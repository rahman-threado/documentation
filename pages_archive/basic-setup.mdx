# Initial setup for ROQ's UI Components

{/* TODO Intro neu */}
Welcome to the "Getting Started" page of our technical documentation! Here, you will find all the necessary information
to help you get up and running ROQ’s features **without using ROQ's authentication**. This page provides you with
step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring ROQ.

[//]: # (<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">)

[//]: # (  You can find a working and fully integrated example application based on)

[//]: # (  Next.js and Prisma ORM on Github:)

<Callout emoji="💡">
  In case you are stuck, we are just one message away. Just join the [Community
  Slack](http://roqstars.com/)
  and get instant responses from our engineers.
</Callout>

## (1) Client side installation

Install ROQ’s UI components by running this NPM command.

{/* TODO npm install @roq/nextjs */}

<Tabs items={['React', 'Next.js']}><Tab>

```shell
npm i --save @roq/ui-react
```

</Tab><Tab>

```shell
npm install @roq/nextjs --save
```

</Tab></Tabs>

At the moment, ROQ is available for React only.
However, if you need support for other libraries like Vue.js or
Angular, don't hesitate to contact us
on [Slack](http://roqstars.com/).

## (2) Server side installation

On the server side of your application, you need to install [ROQ's SDK](/development-guides/sdk-api):

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'Next.js']}><Tab>

```shell
npm install @roq/nextjs --save
```

</Tab><Tab>

Nothing to install because `@roq/nextjs` contains everything you need

</Tab></Tabs>

Please create a free account in the [**console**](https://console.roq.tech) and get your environment credentials.
To install ROQ you need the `apiKey`, `environmentId` and the `host`. To learn more about the SDK, please
read the [Using SDK](/development-guides/sdk-api) section.

Now you can initialize the services using the credentials on the backend-side of your application.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The credentials must not be shared with anyone. It's highly recommended to
  provide the credentials as environment variables and don't commit them into
  your repository.
</Callout>

```typescript
import { Platform } from "@roq/nodejs";

const client = new Platform({
  environmentId: "abc",
  apiKey: "abc",
  host: "abc",
});
```

[//]: # (👀 You can find an example usage)

[//]: # (here: [roq-nextjs-prisma-quickstart/src/server/roq/roq.client.ts]&#40;https://github.com/roqtech/roq-nextjs-prisma-quickstart/blob/main/src/server/roq/roq.client.ts&#41;)

## (3) Synchronize user data

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This step is only needed if you don't use ROQ's [authentication
  feature](/authentication).
</Callout>

In case you don't use ROQ's authentication, you need to synchronize some of your user data.
Please follow the instructions on this page: [Sync Users](/user-management/advanced/sync-user)

## (4) Pass token from server to client-side

{/* TODO does this still make sense with ROQ Auth? */}

The AuthorisationClientService is used to fetch user tokens from ROQ Platform. You can create a token of a user with the
`createUserToken` method and the ID which you received from the `createUser` method previously:

{/* TODO replace code with SDK, see https://roqtechnology.slack.com/archives/C02C4761R9N/p1672854774743939 */}

```tsx
const roqAccessToken = await client.authorization.createUserToken(
  user.roqUserId
);
```

[//]: # (👀 You can find an example usage)

[//]: # (here: [roq-nextjs-prisma-quickstart/src/pages/api/auth/...nextauth.ts]&#40;https://github.com/roqtech/roq-nextjs-prisma-quickstart/blob/main/src/pages/api/auth/%5B...nextauth%5D.ts#L41&#41;)

The token needs to be passed over to your client-side. The specific implementation depends on your framework. 

[//]: # (Feel free to look into the code of the [example app]&#40;https://github.com/roqtech/roq-nextjs-prisma-quickstart&#41; to see )

[//]: # (how it needs to be wired-up.)

## (5) Install `<RoqProvider/>` on client-side

To use ROQ's UI components, you need to wrap your application into the `<RoqProvider/>` which provides all the
required configuration. The minimum working setup requires three props: `host` (~ URL of ROQ Platform) and `getToken`.

Read the documentation about [`<RoqProvider/>`](/development-guides/roq-provider) for more details.

```tsx
import { RoqProvider } from "@roq/ui-react";
import { getUserToken } from "<..yourlib/auth>";
import "@roq/ui-react/dist/index.css";

function App() {
  const token = getUserToken();

  return (
    <RoqProvider
      config={{
        host: "https://...",
        token,
      }}
    >
      <Component />
    </RoqProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Debug mode

To help understand what was going on under the hood, you could use the debug mode for additional logging in your development environment.
When this is enabled, logs are written to your browser console.

```tsx
import { RoqProvider } from "@roq/ui-react";
import { getUserToken } from "<..yourlib/auth>";
import "@roq/ui-react/dist/index.css";

function App() {
  const token = getUserToken();

  return (
    <RoqProvider
      debug
      config={{
        host: "https://...",
        token,
      }}
    >
      <Component />
    </RoqProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Handling errors

It's highly recommended to add error handling on your application, and you can do so using the `onError` callback.

```tsx
import { RoqProvider } from "@roq/ui-react";
import { refetchSession, getUserToken, handleError } from "<..yourlib/auth>";
import "@roq/ui-react/dist/index.css";

function App() {
  const token = getUserToken();

  return (
    <RoqProvider
      config={{
        host: "https://...",
        token,
      }}
      onError={handleError}
      onTokenExpired={refetchSession}
    >
      <Component />
    </RoqProvider>
  );
}
```
